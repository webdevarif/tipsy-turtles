It is likely too late to whitelist, but to be sure, confirm by reaching out on discord in the channel #ask-the-team. The mint will be done in phases - whitelisted members for the first two hours, with a restriction of 2 per wallet; and then the public phase directly afterwards, with no restrictions on the number a wallet can mint. Keen to note is that this CIP-68 mint will be done entirely on a \"first come, first serve\" basis, including the oversubscribed whitelist phase. Leave the drinks at the BAR, and be sure to mint promptly!</p><p>Lastly, if you won a \"free mint\", you will instead be airdropped an NFT at no cost to you, and allowed to mint in the whitelist phase at the standard discount. </p>"
